⚠️ **_DetectionMetrics_ has been renamed as _PerceptionMetrics_**

## Why the rename?

_DetectionMetrics_ was originally developed to evaluate visual **object detection** models. Over time, the project expanded to support **semantic segmentation** for both **images and LiDAR**, along with broader perception evaluation workflows.

At this point, the original name no longer reflected the scope of the toolkit. The project was therefore renamed to _**PerceptionMetrics**_.
