[**The Google Summer of Code**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC), is an international annual program, first held from May to August 2005, in which Google awards stipends, which depends on the purchasing power parity of the country the student's university belongs to, to all students who successfully complete a requested free and open-source software coding project during the summer. The program is open to university students aged 18 or over. (source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code)).

<!-- Once again, Google has selected JdeRobot to continue growing as a robotics project by reaching out to collaborators around the world. An exciting adventure. You can see the [**current projects here**](/activities/gsoc/2021): -->

<!-- JdeRobot has been selected as mentoring organization for GSoC-2024. You can see the [**proposed projects here**](/activities/gsoc/2024): -->

JdeRobot is applying as mentoring organization for GSoC-2025. You can see the [**proposed projects here**](/activities/gsoc/2025):
