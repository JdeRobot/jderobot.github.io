Robotics applications are typically distributed, made up of a collection of concurrent asynchronous components which communicate using some middleware (ROS messages, DDS...). Building robotics applications is a complex task. Integrating existing nodes or libraries that provide already solved functionality, and using several tools may increase the software robustness and shorten the development time. JdeRobot provides several tools, libraries and reusable nodes. They have been written in C++, Python or JavaScript. They are ROS-friendly and full compatible with ROS2-Humble (and Gazebo Harmonic).

Our community mainly works on three development areas:

- Education in Robotics. [RoboticsAcademy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/) is our main project. It is a ROS-based framework to learn robotics and computer vision with drones, autonomous cars.... It is a collection of Python programmed exercises and challenges for engineering students.

- Robot Programming Tools. For instance, [BT-Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio), for robot programming with Behavior Trees; [VisualCircuit](https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/) for robot programming with connected blocks, as in electronic circuits, in a visual way.

- Machine Learning in Robotics. For instance, the [BehaviorMetrics tool](https://jderobot.github.io/BehaviorMetrics/) for assessment of neural networks in end-to-end autonomous driving. Another example is [PerceptionMetrics tool](https://github.com/JdeRobot/PerceptionMetrics) for unified evaluation of 2D and 3D perception models.

# Ideas list

This open source organization welcomes contributors in these topics:

## Project #1: PerceptionMetrics: GUI extension and support for standard datasets and models

**Brief explanation**: [PerceptionMetrics](https://jderobot.github.io/PerceptionMetrics/) is a toolkit for evaluating perception models across frameworks and datasets. Past GSoC projects ([Vinay Sharma, 2017](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/2017-colab-vinay_sharma), [Jeevan Kumar, 2019](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/colab-gsoc2019-Jeevan_Kumar/)) contributed to its first stable release, published in _Sensors_ ([Paniego et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/s22124575)). Recently, the tool has been revamped to support LiDAR, image segmentation, and object detection ([Sakhineti Praveena, 2025](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/gsoc2025-Sakhineti_Praveena)).

Moving beyond our current focus on off-road navigation, this project aims to scale _PerceptionMetrics_ for industry-standard benchmarks. The main goals are:

- Exploring core segmentation/detection datasets in the industry for image and LiDAR (e.g., SemanticKITTI, Cityscapes), prioritizing, and adding support for them.
- Extending the GUI to support image and LiDAR segmentation visualization (currently limited to object detection).
- Generating comprehensive tutorials and documentation for different use cases, models, and data formats.
- Improving the robustness of the project through an improved test suite.

- **Mentors**: David Pascual Hernández (d.pascualhe AT gmail.com), Sakhineti Praveena (sakhinetipraveena AT gmail.com)

## Project #2: Robotics Academy: extend C++ support for more exercises

**Brief explanation**: [Robotics-Academy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy) is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises. The students have to code in Python the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision. It uses standard middleware and libraries such as ROS 2 or OpenCV.

Nowadays, Robotics Academy offers the student up to 26 exercises. All of them come ready to use in the RoboticsAcademy docker image (RADI). The only requirement for the students its to download the docker image, all the dependencies are installed inside the RADI.

Currently, exercises can be solved using Python with our Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) or directly using ROS 2 interfaces (topics and services). Right now there are 2 exercises that also support C++: follow line and vacuum cleaner. The goal of this project would be to expand the selection of exercises that support the C++ language.

## Project #3: Robotics Academy: New power tower inspection using deep learning

**Brief explanation**: The goal of this project is to develop a new deep learning based challenge in [RoboticsAcademy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/) for power tower inspection. In addition to the existing [classical power inspection](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/exercises/Drones/power_tower_inspection) exercise, this project will introduce a new challenge where defect detection and classification are performed using a deep learning model trained and provided by the student, instead of relying on traditional image processing techniques. The expected work for this project includes:
- Create new exercise, following the example of previous deep learning based exercises such as [end-to-end visual control](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/exercises/AutonomousCars/end_to_end_visual_control/).
- Extend or create simulated power tower environments and record and label datasets for students to train their models on.
- Build comprehensive documentation, upload datasets to accessible repositories, and provide Jupyter Notebooks or similar materials to guide students.
- Extend the *Simple API* used by deep learning exercises to define a structured way of setting results such as classification logits, bounding boxes for detection, and confidence scores.

## Project #4: RoboticsAcademy: drone-cat-mouse chase exercise, two controlled robots at the same time

**Brief explanation**:  The goal of this project is to recover the drone-cat-mouse chase challenge in the new [RoboticsAcademy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/) architecture. This exercise requires the support for two robotics applications connected to the corresponding drones, one connected to the mouse-drone (which may fly autonomously following a 3D position pattern) and the second connected to the cat-drone. The RoboticsAcademy user has to program the cat-drone so it successfully chases the drone-mouse. This challenge should work in Gazebo Harmonic and use Aerostack2 middleware for drones, as all current available drone exercises at RoboticsAcademy. Additional exercises involving two concurrent agents in the same robotic world may also be designed using this plumbing.

- **Mentors**: José María Cañas (josemaria.plaza AT gmail.com) and Prajyot (prajyotj04 AT gmail.com)


## Project #5: Robotics Academy: using the Open3DEngine as robotics simulator

**Brief explanation**: Open 3D Engine (O3DE) is an Apache 2.0-licensed multi-platform 3D engine that enables developers and content creators to build AAA games, cinema-quality 3D worlds, and high-fidelity simulations. It supports also simulation of most common robot sensors and actuators. The idea of this project is to integrate Open3DEngine into the RoboticsAcademy framework, with at least one exercise using it instead of Gazebo.

## Project #6: VisualCircuit: Improving Functionality & Expanding the Block Library

**Brief explanation**: VisualCircuit allows users to program robotic intelligence using a visual language similar to electronic circuits, simplifying the creation of code for robotics applications such as Deep Learning, ROS, and more.

Over the past few years, we have focused on making VisualCircuit more robust by resolving Nested Blocks (multi-level blocks) with the Block Composition feature, developing a working prototype for dockerized execution of robotics applications directly from the browser, migrating the old POSIX IPC implementation to a cross-platform compatible Python Shared Memory implementation, and more.

Now, for GSoC 2026, the goal of the project is to further refine VisualCircuit by improving Shared Memory, Block Composition, and other features, developing more real-world robotics applications utilizing the latest functionalities of VC, expanding the block library to cater to a larger audience, and enhancing automated testing. Additionally, we aim to address other issues such as implementing Undo and Redo functionality, adding more keyboard shortcuts for faster circuit creation, and making various other improvements.
You can read further about the tool on the [website](https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/).

## Project #7: Robotics Academy: Exploring optimization strategies for RoboticsBackend container

**Brief explanation**: Our [Robotics Academy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy) platform relies on a containerized environment that encapsulates robotics middleware, simulators, libraries, and the application management stack: the **RoboticsBackend**. This approach significantly lowers the technical entry barrier for students, allowing them to start learning robotics without dealing with complex environment setup. However, the large number of coexisting dependencies causes the container image to grow substantially in size, negatively affecting maintainability and increasing download times for first time users.

This project has a twofold objective. First, it aims to identify bottlenecks in the current container build and propose concrete strategies to reduce image size and build time. Potential approaches include layer optimization, dependency pruning, replacing heavy libraries such as OMPL when viable, and providing minimal installation variants for components like Aerostack2. Second, the project will explore alternative container technologies, such as Podman, as a replacement for Docker in the build pipeline. Podman offers a daemonless and rootless execution model while maintaining compatibility with existing container workflows, potentially improving security, portability, and maintainability.

<img src="/assets/images/activities/gsoc/dockertopodman.png">

- **Skills required/preferred**: Docker, Linux fundamentals, familiarity with common robotic software stack
- **Difficulty rating**: Medium
- **Expected results**: An optimized RoboticsBackend and a feasibility study of migration to Podman
- **Expected size**: 175h
- **Mentors**: Nikhil Gupta and Miguel Fernández


## Project #8: Robotics Academy: palletizing with an industrial robot exercise

**Brief explanation**: A few years ago we developed some exercises on industrial robots using MoveIt1 and ROS1-Noetic. A Work-In-Progress from the JdeRobot Industrial Robotics Working Group is the support in RoboticsAcademy to MoveIt2 and ROS2. Currently two exercises are available: (a) the Pick and Place application and (b) the MachineVision application (from GSoC-2025). The main goal of this project is to create a palletizing exercise with an industrial robot (UR5) over the base of the current exercises at RoboticsAcademy using ROS2, MoveIt2 and the easy API for the programming of industrial robots (similar to other solutions such as RAPID from ABB already available).

<!-- # How to increase your chances of being selected in GSoC-2025

If you put yourself in the shoes of the mentor that should select the student, you'll immediately realize that there are some behaviors that are usually rewarded. Here's some examples.

1. **Be proactive**: Mentors are more likely to select students that openly discuss the existing ideas and / or propose their own. It is a **bad idea** to just submit your idea only in the Google web site without discussing it, because it won't be noticed.

2. **Demonstrate your skills**: Consider that mentors are being contacted by several students that apply for the same project. A way to show that you are the best candidate, is to demonstrate that you are familiar with the software and you can code. How? Browse the bug tracker (issues in github of JdeRobot project), fix some bugs and propose your patch submitting your PullRequest, and/or ask mentors to challenge you! Moreover, bug fixes are a great way to get familiar with the code.

3. **Demonstrate your intention to stay**: Students that are likely to disappear after GSoC are less likely to be selected. This is because there is no point in developing something that won't be maintained. And moreover, one scope of GSoC is to bring new developers to the community.
