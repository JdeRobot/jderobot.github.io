Robotics applications are typically distributed, made up of a collection of concurrent asynchronous components which communicate using some middleware (ROS messages, DDS...). Building robotics applications is a complex task. Integrating existing nodes or libraries that provide already solved functionality, and using several tools may increase the software robustness and shorten the development time. JdeRobot provides several tools, libraries and reusable nodes. They have been written in C++, Python or JavaScript. They are ROS-friendly and full compatible with ROS2-Humble (and Gazebo Harmonic).

Our community mainly works on three development areas:

- Education in Robotics. [RoboticsAcademy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/) is our main project. It is a ROS-based framework to learn robotics and computer vision with drones, autonomous cars.... It is a collection of Python programmed exercises and challenges for engineering students.

- Robot Programming Tools. For instance, [BT-Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio), for robot programming with Behavior Trees; [VisualCircuit](https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/) for robot programming with connected blocks, as in electronic circuits, in a visual way.

- Machine Learning in Robotics. For instance, the [BehaviorMetrics tool](https://jderobot.github.io/BehaviorMetrics/) for assessment of neural networks in end-to-end autonomous driving. Another example is [PerceptionMetrics tool](https://github.com/JdeRobot/PerceptionMetrics) for unified evaluation of 2D and 3D perception models.

# Ideas list

This open source organization welcomes contributors in these topics:

## Project #1: PerceptionMetrics: GUI extension and support for standard datasets and models

**Brief explanation**: [PerceptionMetrics](https://jderobot.github.io/PerceptionMetrics/) is a toolkit for evaluating perception models across frameworks and datasets. Past GSoC projects ([Vinay Sharma, 2017](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/2017-colab-vinay_sharma), [Jeevan Kumar, 2019](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/colab-gsoc2019-Jeevan_Kumar/)) contributed to its first stable release, published in _Sensors_ ([Paniego et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/s22124575)). Recently, the tool has been revamped to support LiDAR, image segmentation, and object detection ([Sakhineti Praveena, 2025](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/gsoc2025-Sakhineti_Praveena)).

Moving beyond our current focus on off-road navigation, this project aims to scale _PerceptionMetrics_ for industry-standard benchmarks. The main goals are:

- Exploring core segmentation/detection datasets in the industry for image and LiDAR (e.g., SemanticKITTI, Cityscapes), prioritizing, and adding support for them.
- Extending the GUI to support image and LiDAR segmentation visualization (currently limited to object detection).
- Generating comprehensive tutorials and documentation for different use cases, models, and data formats.
- Improving the robustness of the project through an improved test suite.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeIdPerceptionMetrics %}

- **Skills required/preferred**: Python, PyTorch, Deep Learning, Streamlit
- **Difficulty rating**: Medium
- **Expected results**: Support for new datasets, GUI extension for image and LiDAR segmentation, and comprehensive technical documentation.
- **Expected size**: Long (~350h)
- **Mentors**: David Pascual Hernández (d.pascualhe AT gmail.com), Sakhineti Praveena (sakhinetipraveena AT gmail.com)

## Project #2: Robotics Academy: extend C++ support for more exercises

**Brief explanation**: [Robotics-Academy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy) is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises. The students have to code in Python the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision. It uses standard middleware and libraries such as ROS 2 or OpenCV.

Nowadays, Robotics Academy offers the student up to 26 exercises. All of them come ready to use in the RoboticsAcademy docker image (RADI). The only requirement for the students its to download the docker image, all the dependencies are installed inside the RADI.

Currently, exercises can be solved using Python with our Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) or directly using ROS 2 interfaces (topics and services). Right now there are 2 exercises that also support C++: follow line and vacuum cleaner. The goal of this project would be to expand the selection of exercises that support the C++ language.

- **Skills required/preferred**: Python, C++, ROS2
- **Difficulty rating**: Medium
- **Expected results**: Extend C++ support for more exercises providing a simplified API and direct ROS
- **Expected size**: 90h
- **Mentors**: Javier Izquierdo Hernández (javizqh AT pm.me), Nikhil Gupta

<!-- # How to increase your chances of being selected in GSoC-2025

If you put yourself in the shoes of the mentor that should select the student, you'll immediately realize that there are some behaviors that are usually rewarded. Here's some examples.

1. **Be proactive**: Mentors are more likely to select students that openly discuss the existing ideas and / or propose their own. It is a **bad idea** to just submit your idea only in the Google web site without discussing it, because it won't be noticed.

2. **Demonstrate your skills**: Consider that mentors are being contacted by several students that apply for the same project. A way to show that you are the best candidate, is to demonstrate that you are familiar with the software and you can code. How? Browse the bug tracker (issues in github of JdeRobot project), fix some bugs and propose your patch submitting your PullRequest, and/or ask mentors to challenge you! Moreover, bug fixes are a great way to get familiar with the code.

3. **Demonstrate your intention to stay**: Students that are likely to disappear after GSoC are less likely to be selected. This is because there is no point in developing something that won't be maintained. And moreover, one scope of GSoC is to bring new developers to the community.
