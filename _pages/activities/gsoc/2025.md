Robotics applications are typically distributed, made up of a collection of concurrent asynchronous components which communicate using some middleware (ROS messages, DDS...). Building robotics applications is a complex task. Integrating existing nodes or libraries that provide already solved functionality, and using several tools may increase the software robustness and shorten the development time. JdeRobot provides several tools, libraries and reusable nodes. They have been written in C++, Python or JavaScript. They are ROS-friendly and full compatible with ROS2-Humble (and Gazebo Harmonic).


Our community mainly works on three development areas:
- Education in Robotics. [RoboticsAcademy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/) is our main project. It is a ROS-based framework to learn robotics and computer vision with drones, autonomous cars.... It is a collection of Python programmed exercises and challenges for engineering students.

- Robot Programming Tools. For instance, [BT-Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio), for robot programming with Behavior Trees; [VisualCircuit](https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/) for robot programming with connected blocks, as in electronic circuits, in a visual way.

- Machine Learning in Robotics. For instance, the [BehaviorMetrics tool](https://jderobot.github.io/BehaviorMetrics/) for assessment of neural networks in end-to-end autonomous driving. Another example is [DetectionMetrics tool](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DetectionMetrics) for evaluation of visual detection neural networks and algorithms.

<!---
 - Reconfigurable Computing in Robotics. [FPGA-Robotics](https://github.com/JdeRobot/FPGA-robotics) for programming robots with reconfigurable computing (FPGAs) using open tools as IceStudio and F4PGA. Verilog-based reusable blocks for robotics applications.

# Ideas list

This open source organization welcomes contributors in these topics:

## Project #1: Robotics-Academy: support for solutions directly using ROS2 topics

**Brief explanation**: [Robotics-Academy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy) is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises. The students have to code in Python the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision. It uses standard middleware and libraries such as ROS 2 or OpenCV.

Nowadays, Robotics Academy offers the student up to 26 exercises, and another 11 prototype exercises. All of them come ready to use in the RoboticsAcademy docker image (RADI). The only requirement for the students its to download the docker image, all the dependencies are installed inside the RADI.

Currently, exercises can be solved using Python without any knowledge of ROS 2 thank to our Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). However, some students asked for the possibility to use (and learn) ROS 2 interfaces (topics and services) while coding the solution. Project #2 will explore new ways of coding the exercise solution, where a few changes like ROS 2 spin control or editor autocompletions are required.

- **Skills required/preferred**: React, Python, ROS2.
- **Difficulty rating**: medium
- **Expected results**: New way of coding your solutions in RoboticsAcademy using ROS 2 topics
- **Expected size**: 90h
- **Mentors**: Pedro Arias (pedro.ariasp AT upm.es) and Apoorv Garg (apoorvgarg.ms AT gmail.com)

## Project #2: Robotics-Academy: CI & Testing

**Brief explanation**: [Robotics-Academy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy) is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises. The students have to code in Python the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision.

Project #2 seeks to identify and address potential issues early on, fostering the maintainability and reliability of its software. This commitment to improving the quality of the software will be achieved through the implementation of automated testing and continuous integration (CI) processes. The project will also include the development of a testing strategy and the implementation of a CI pipeline.

- **Skills required/preferred**: Docker, GitHub actions, Python, JavaScript, pytest, Selenium
- **Difficulty rating**: medium

## Project #4: Robotics-Academy: new exercise on End-to-End Visual Control of an Autonomous Vehicle using DeepLearning

**Brief explanation**: The goal of this project is to develop a new deep learning exercise focused on visual robotic control in the context of Robotics-Academy. We will create a web-based interface that allows users to upload a trained model, which will take camera input from a drone or car and output the linear speed and angular velocity of the vehicle. The controlled robot and its environment will be simulated using Gazebo. The objectives of this project include:

- Updating the web interface to accept models trained with PyTorch/TensorFlow.
- Building new widgets to monitor exercise results.
- Preparing a simulated environment.
- Coding the core application that feeds input data to the trained model and returns the results.
- Training a naive model to demonstrate how the exercise can be solved.

This new exercise may utilize the infrastructure developed for the ["Human detection" Deep Learning exercise](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/exercises/ComputerVision/human_detection). The following videos showcase one of our current web-based exercises and a visual control task solved using deep learning:

## Project #5: VisualCircuit: Improving Functionality & Expanding the Block Library

**Brief explanation**: VisualCircuit allows users to program robotic intelligence using a visual language similar to electronic circuits, simplifying the creation of code for robotics applications such as Deep Learning, ROS, and more.

Over the past few years, we have focused on making VisualCircuit more robust by resolving Nested Blocks (multi-level blocks) with the Block Composition feature, developing a working prototype for dockerized execution of robotics applications directly from the browser, migrating the old POSIX IPC implementation to a cross-platform compatible Python Shared Memory implementation, and more.

Now, for GSoC 2025, the goal of the project is to further refine VisualCircuit by improving Shared Memory, Block Composition, and other features, developing more real-world robotics applications utilizing the latest functionalities of VC, expanding the block library to cater to a larger audience, and enhancing automated testing. Additionally, we aim to address other issues such as implementing Undo and Redo functionality, adding more keyboard shortcuts for faster circuit creation, and making various other improvements.
You can read further about the tool on the [website](https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/).

Our [BT-Studio](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio) has been created to provide a web based graphical editor of Behavior Trees. It also includes a conversor to Python language, the dockerized execution of the generated robotics application from the browser and supports subtrees (a feature created along a previous [GSoC-2024 project](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/gsoc2024-Oscar_Martinez/)).

The goal of this GSoC proposed project is to develop a Behavior Tree library, a collection of example robotics applications and further refine the tool.

## Project #10: Extend DetectionMetrics: GUI, CI Workflow, and Object Detection

**Brief explanation**: [DetectionMetrics](https://jderobot.github.io/DetectionMetrics/) is a toolkit for evaluating perception models across frameworks and datasets. Past GSoC projects ([Vinay Sharma](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/2017-colab-vinay_sharma), [Jeevan Kumar](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/colab-gsoc2019-Jeevan_Kumar/)) contributed to its first stable release, published in Sensors ([Paniego et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/s22124575)). Recently, we revamped the tool to improve usability and installation—check it out [here](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DetectionMetrics)!
Currently, DetectionMetrics functions as both a Python library and CLI, focusing on the quantitative evaluation of image and LiDAR segmentation models, with plans to expand into object detection. It supports PyTorch and TensorFlow models, along with multiple public datasets. Its modular design allows easy integration of new models and datasets.
While redesigning the core functionality, some useful features were lost. This project aims to bring them back and enhance DetectionMetrics by:

* **Recovering object detection evaluation support**, including metrics like mAP and IoU. This involves restoring compatibility with COCO-style and Pascal VOC-style datasets and implementing necessary pipeline adjustments.
* **Building a GUI** for visualizing dataset samples (images, point clouds) and evaluation results (IoU, confusion matrices, etc.). Ideally, it will also provide an interactive interface for launching batched evaluation jobs. Possible tools: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/).
* **Setting up a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow** to automate testing, documentation generation, and versioning using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

Since this new version of _DetectionMetrics_ is still in its early stages, your contributions will have a lasting impact on a tool already featured in a scientific journal!

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeIdDetectionMetrics %}

- **Skills required/preferred**: Python, GitHub Actions, PyTorch, Deep Learning
- **Difficulty rating**: Medium
- **Expected results**: A brand-new GUI and CI workflow for DetectionMetrics

# How to increase your chances of being selected in GSoC-2025

If you put yourself in the shoes of the mentor that should select the student, you'll immediately realize that there are some behaviors that are usually rewarded. Here's some examples.

1. **Be proactive**: Mentors are more likely to select students that openly discuss the existing ideas and / or propose their own. It is a **bad idea** to just submit your idea only in the Google web site without discussing it, because it won't be noticed.

2. **Demonstrate your skills**: Consider that mentors are being contacted by several students that apply for the same project. A way to show that you are the best candidate, is to demonstrate that you are familiar with the software and you can code. How? Browse the bug tracker (issues in github of JdeRobot project), fix some bugs and propose your patch submitting your PullRequest, and/or ask mentors to challenge you! Moreover, bug fixes are a great way to get familiar with the code.

3. **Demonstrate your intention to stay**: Students that are likely to disappear after GSoC are less likely to be selected. This is because there is no point in developing something that won't be maintained. And moreover, one scope of GSoC is to bring new developers to the community.
